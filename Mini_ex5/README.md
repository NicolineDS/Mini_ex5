My program consists of a fish, which is swimming in the ocean. The fish can be moved around on the screen by using the mouse. The program also consists of six bubbles that the fish can interact with. When the fish touched the bubbles the fish is rotating around itâ€™s own centre.
I have made a class for the bubbles. It was a very long process to define all of the bubbles and I know there is a more simple way to make the bubbles but I chose to write a longer code so I could get a better understanding of how it works. I got help from one of our instructors to make the fish rotate when it touches the bubbles. To create the if-syntax was a long process but was all worth it in the end and I got a better understanding of how to create a more complex if syntax. This mini_ex has been a challenge but also a great learning experience, I have learned to make a class and how to make a object rotate by using if-syntaxes.
