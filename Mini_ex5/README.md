My program: https://github.com/NicolineDS/Mini_ex5/blob/master/Mini_ex5/empty-example/index.html
(I could not get the link to run on my computer, but I could not find the problem)

My program consists of a fish, which is swimming in the ocean. The fish can be moved around by using the mouse. The program also consists of six bubbles that the fish can interact with. When the fish touched the bubbles the fish is rotating around itâ€™s own centre.
I have made a class for the bubbles. It was a very long process to define all of the bubbles and I know there is a more simple way to make the bubbles but I chose to write all aspects of the code so I could create a better understanding of how a class works. I got help from one of our instructors to make the fish rotate when it touches the bubbles. To create the if-statement was a long process but was all worth it in the end and I got a better understanding of how to create a more complex if-statement. This mini_ex has been a challenge but also a great learning experience, I have learned to make a class and how to make a object rotate by using if-statements. I am excited to see how I can inprove my if-statements and how I can continue making classes but making them shorter and more simple.
